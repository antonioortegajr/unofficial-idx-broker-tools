# unofficial-idx-broker-tools

This Repo will house any unofficial idx broker tools

NONE of these tools will be supported by IDX Broker in ANY way.

Please DO NOT contact IDX Broker support regarding these tools.

All tools will be in PHP.

Tools I have already created will move to this repo for new development.

Each tool will have it's own ReadMe.md

Live tools on heroku: https://unofficial-idx-broker-tools.herokuapp.com/


##Current Tools:

## Site Analyzer
Check a page for SEO attributes. Return things like mobile friendliness and if the page contains iframes.

## API Quick Tester
This is a very simple tester of API keys and calls to the IDX Broker API.

## Find Advanced Fields
Use the API to list all advanced fields and then click on one to see the search field values.

###Dependancies

Each tool is meant to be stand alone. Even if they preform similar functions like making an API call the tools do not share files or functions. This is so you can take any one of them and use with out the other tools.

##About
This collect was put together for the benifit of anyone supporting an IDX Broker account(s).


## Run on Heroku
